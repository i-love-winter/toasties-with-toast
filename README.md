- 👋 Hi, I’m @toasties-with-toast
- 👀 I’m interested in coding (duh) and ~ricing my Arch Linux~ working on Solstice OS
- 🌱 I’m currently learning random small pieces about C, the god of all programming languages, and bashing my head against the keyboard when my code doesn't work
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making SolsticeOS, my custom OS I've been making for the past while
- 📫 How to reach me: imatoaster65@gmail.com
